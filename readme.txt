> Autonami looks FANTASTIC! One of the things I love the most about WooFunnels is that not only is everything incredibly functional, but it's well thought out too. You can tell a lot of time has been put into making the UI as intuitive and easy as possible. :) It's perfect. I'm going to be using it for all my abandon cart emails going forward. It's MUCH easier to set up than my current solution! :)
> I'm really excited to see what you guys come up with, in the new year. :)

**2. [Set up WooCommerce Follow-Up Emails for Post-Purchase Engagement](https://buildwoofunnels.com/woocommerce-follow-up-emails/?utm_source=autonami-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=follow-up-campaigns)**
Post-purchase or follow-up emails are sent out to engage with your customers after they've just bought from you.
Here are some of the post-purchase engagement emails you can send:

- Shipment Check-In Email - Check with your new buyers about their shopping experience with you.
- Cross-sell or product recommendation email - Send automated emails to recommend products to customers based on the items they bought.
- Purchase anniversary email - Create an automated anniversary campaign with a discount coupon on the 6-months or 1-year anniversary.
- Product education email - Educate them on how to use the product that they've just bought. This depends on what item they purchased and if that needs education.

Take a look at the video to see all the post-purchase use cases:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPVvHRQiKX4

An existing buyer is 9 times more likely to buy again than a new prospect.

In fact, post-purchase emails have an average open rate of 40.5% which is way higher than blast campaigns.

Autonami lets you communicate with buyers to strengthen the relationship and lay the ground for the second sale.


== Autonami Premium Use Cases ==

**1. [Create irresistible customer Win-Back Campaigns](https://buildwoofunnels.com/wordpress-marketing-automation-autonami/?utm_source=autonami-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=win-back-campaigns)**
Win-back campaigns attempt to bring your lapsed/ inactive customers back to your store.
Autonami lets you:

- Define the period of inactivity i.e. for how long a customer has been inactive and not made a purchase in the past
- Send a personalized coupon code to win back inactive customers
- Create a sequence of emails that go out at set time of the day or day of the week to recover abandoned carts

You can also define the time when you want the win-back emails to be sent.

- When a new subscriber joins
- When their trial is about to end
- When they're approaching a renewal
- When their subscription has ended

And many other subscription-specific events.

Autonami integrates with AffiliateWP to let you send engagement emails to your affiliates. You'll need to have the AffiliateWP plugin installed and activated for this.
AffiliateWP allows you to manage your affiliates - their commission rate, referrals, etc.
Autonami uses this affiliate-related data to let you segment your affiliates and have targeted communication with them.
Here are some interesting events that Autonami provides to engage with affiliates:

- Affiliate Makes A Sale: Send out an automated email to congratulate your affiliates when they make a sale. It's a good way to encourage them.

Autonami seamlessly integrates with popular form builders. So, when a user submits a form, you can take actions in WordPress, WooCommerce, CRMs or Connectors (Slack, Twilio).
You can take different actions for different users based on the values in the form fields.
You can also add a tag, update a custom field, add to a list and more based on the information they filled out.


**5. [Talk to your favourite CRM - Integrates with Active Campaign, ConvertKit and Drip](https://buildwoofunnels.com/wordpress-marketing-automation-autonami/?utm_source=autonami-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=autoresponders)**
Autonami integrates with ActiveCampaign, Drip, and ConvertKit and lets you take actions like - add a tag, remove a tag, update custom fields, add to a list and so much more.
It allows you to segment your email campaigns and target your users based on their behavior.
Consider adding a new subscriber to a Welcome series email automation in your CRM.

- **Twilio for SMS-based campaigns** - Autonami's integration with Twilio lets you run SMS campaigns in WooCommerce/ WordPress.
You can also add emojis to your SMS and add images for your USA/ Canada based audience.
According to Sales Cycle, SMS has an open rate of 98% with 90% of messages opened within three minutes.

- **Slack for administrative notifications** - Autonami's integration with Slack enables you to get notified through a channel, or individually when an event takes place.
This means you can always stay updated on Slack for the events happening in your store/ site. It allows you to not just do your marketing better but also manage admin related work better.
For example, when an item stock gets reduced, set up an automation to get a Slack message.

- **Zapier to speak with 100s of other apps** - Zapier has 1000's of integrations within itself. So Autonami's connection with Zapier allows you to unlock its limitless potential.
It's because Zapier integrates with Twitter, Google Sheet, MailChimp and many other popular apps.

So you can connect your WordPress site/ WooCommerce store to Zapier.


**What Autonami users are saying**

> Using email and SMS both to recover carts, working flawlessly!
> I’ve been using Autonami for 24 hours and so far recovered 20% of my average daily revenue. I’m using SMS and email for cart abandonment automations, both work flawlessly. I’m also using the 'Send to Zapier' option to collect data on a Google sheet. I compared my website’s loading speed with and without Autonami, it didn’t affect the load time all that much! Very happy with the product so far.

-- Borja Obseso (Founder, CreativiU Elite)

> Genius product, I am loving it...it is working like a clockwork!
> I grabbed a copy of Autonami! It is EXCELLENT! I am using it mainly for the subscription side of things to ensure I get people back to the site after failed payments and reduced rates for cancellations. So far it is working like clockwork! I have many more emails I want to set up with it, but I am swamped. It came out at just the right time.  Genius product, I am loving it. Now to integrate Autonami with those checkouts for abandoned carts  You ladies and gentlemen are awesome!

-- Blake Rudis (Founder, F64 Academy)

> I installed Autonami Lite today to give it a test drive...just wanted to email to say I am super impressed.
> The possibilities are truly endless. This plugin can let even a one-man show Woocommerce website run with the power of a full-blown marketing team.
> What really impresses me about XL Plugins is the quality of your plugins, website, videos, and overall approach to marketing your products. I've come across so many buggy or incomplete plugins released by software companies and it's so refreshing to see an Indian company competing at the same level as a US software company.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Autonami a replacement for my CRM? =
Autonami is not built to send out blast emails. For that, use your CRM.
It uses WordPress SMTP or your CRM to send triggered emails to segmented customers. Autonami beautifully integrates with Active Campaign, Drip and ConvertKit to do the job.

= Is there a limit on the number of emails I can send out? =
No, there's no limit on the number of emails because all the emails are routed via your website's SMTP or your CRM.

= How does Autonami ensure my emails never land in the spam folder? =
Since Autonami uses WordPress's SMTP services like Sendgrid, Mailgun, AmazonSES to send emails - these platforms take care of deliverability-related issues.
And when you use your CRM to send emails, it's of course your CRM's job.
Your content must also follow the deliverability best practices.

= How is Autonami's abandoned cart recovery better than that of the other plugins? =
Autonami live-captures emails of the user, which means as soon as they enter it on the checkout page, Autonami captures it to run the campaign.
Apart from that, you can send emails/ SMS to segmented users, based on their cart value, item(s) in cart, coupon used and more.
There's also built-in cart recovery tracking.

= How well does Autonami talk to AeroCheckout? =
Autonami beautifully communicates with AeroCheckout. You can direct your users back to the exact checkout page abandoned and not the cart page.
In case of dedicated product-specific checkouts - this feature is a boon!
The abandoned user will also see their filled date restored on the recovery link.
